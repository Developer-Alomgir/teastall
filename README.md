# Coffee Mama — Next.js + Three.js

Developer: Alomgir Hossen

This project is a port of the user's HTML demo into a Next.js (App Router) project ready to deploy on Vercel.

## How to run locally

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- Three.js scene lives in `components/Scene.js`.
- No external GLTF models were downloaded; the scene uses procedural/high-poly geometry (lathe, more segments).
- Images referenced in original layout use remote Unsplash URLs; you may copy them into `/public` if you want offline asset packaging.

Enjoy! — Alomgir Hossen
